    "If everything went as intended, the file should now show up on your GitHub account in the \"`cmse202-f19-turnin`\" repository inside the `hw-01` directory that you just created.  Periodically, **you'll be asked to commit your changes to the repository and push them to the remote GitHub location**. Of course, you can always commit your changes more often than that, if you wish.  It can be good to get into a habit of committing your changes any time you make a significant modification, or when you stop working on the project for a bit."

The United Nations has recently come out with some updated predictions on world population growth that shows the slowing of growth, reaching a maximum of 11 billion in 2100 with a potential decline worldwide beginning then. This is in contrast to dire predictions of uncontrolled growth from the 1960's on beginning with the book \"The Population Bomb\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Population_Bomb). While overall growth depends primarily on two factors: birth rate and death rate, it is the change in the birth rate that is driving this change. In particular, as women worldwide achieve more wealth and education, they are having fewer children beginning later in life.\n",
