    "There is an imaging library know as `PIL` (caps matter here). What's weird about `PIL` is that it represents an old library that was abandoned but later picked up (forked to be computer-sciencey) under the name *pillow* . However, `pillow` is imported using the old name `PIL` to maintain compatibiliy with old code. So you have to be careful that you have `pillow` as a library even though we still `import PIL`. Anaconda has done that for us but it is good to know, especially if you look up reference material (which should be under *pillow*, not *PIL*). Get all that?\n",

    "- the `Image.open(filename)` will return an `Image` instance from an image file, assuming it can find the file\n",
    "- if you create an `Image` instance, let's call it `img`, then `img.show()` should display the image. (Note: it should pop up a window outside of your notebook)\n",
    "- to gather the underlying matrix from the image instance `img`, you can use `numpy` (which you obviously have to import), as in `numpy.asarray(img)`\n",
    "- to create an image instance from a matrix, you can do `Image.fromarray(yourarray)`\n",
    "- to convert an image from greyscale to RGB(color) you use the `.convert` method. \n",
