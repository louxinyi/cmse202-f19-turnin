    "The goal of this midterm is to give you the opportunity to test out some of the skills that you've developed thus far this semester. In particular, you'll practice setting up a GitHub repository, committing and pushing repository changes, downloading files with command line tools, using documentation to learn about an unfamiliar function, and understand and edit a python class. You should find that you have all of the skills necessary to complete this exam with even just eight weeks of CMSE 202 under your belt!\n",
    "\n",
    "You are encouraged to look through the entire exam before you get started so that you can appropriately budget your time and understand the broad goals of the exam.  If you get stuck on a problem, move on to the next section and return later.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the exam, upload your solutions (**including relevant figures and generated code**) to D2L and also push your changes to your git repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Important note about using online resources**: This exam is \"open internet\". That means that you can look up documentation, google how to accomplish certain Python tasks, etc. Being able to effectively use the internet for computational modeling and data science is a very important skill, so we want to make sure you have the opportunity to exercise that skill. **However**: The use of any person-to-person communication software is absolutely not acceptable. If you are seen accessing your email, using a chat program (e.g. Slack), or any sort of collaborative cloud storage or document software (e.g. Google Documents), you will be at risk for receiving a zero on the exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Keep your eyes on your screen!** Unfortunately, there isn't enough space in the room for everyone to sit at their own table so please do your best to keep your eyes on your own screen. This exam is designed to give *you* the opportunity to show the instructor what you can do and you should hold yourself accountable for maintaining a high level of academic integrity. If any of the instructors observe suspicious behavior, you will, again, risk receiving a zero."

    "\n",
    "Before you get too far along in the assignment, you need to set up a new folder in your **private** GitHub repository that you created for the course. You will store this notebook in that folder and track the changes as you make them. For this section you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Navigate to your local copy of your \"`cmse202-f19-turnin`\" repository.\n",
    "2. In the repository, create a new directory called \"`midterm`\".\n",
    "3. Move this notebook into that new directory within your repository.\n",
    "4. Add the notebook file to your git repository with the appropriate git command.\n",
    "5. Commit the addition to your repository using the appropriate git command.\n",
    "6. Finally, to test that everything is working, \"git push\" the file so that it ends up in your GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Make sure that your instructor and TA have access to the repository (this should already be the case). Their GitHub usernames are \"cmse202-repo\" (for punch) and \"Luis-Polanco\" (for Luis, obviously).**\n",
    "\n",
    "From this point on you will occasionally be asked to save the state of your notebook, commit the changes, and push it to your new repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: If you're struggling with getting the Git repository set up correctly with this new directory, you can always just work on the notebook as is and try to come back and figure out the repository component later. You may lose some points though since you won't have periodic commits as you make progress along the way, but it will be better than not working on the other parts of the exam!\n",
    "\n",
    "###  During the exam you will generate plots that you save to `.png` files, as well as new `.py` files. When you create these new files, don't forget to add them to your repository. You must also turn it in to D2L (See \"Finish Up\" at the end)"

    "The number $\\pi$ is a unusual number in that it is a \"public\" number, books and movies are based on it, and that it has fascinated people for millenium. In case you didn't know (how could that be), the value $\\pi$ is the ratio of the circumference of a circle divided by the length of its diamater. \n",

It is also a *transcendental* number, cannot be the root of any non-zero polynomial equation. As it is irrational, people for centuries have tried various ways to estimate, in modern times to an enormous number of digits, the values of the digits in $\\pi$. We are going to use $\\pi$ as a background to test our abilities in Python."

If we were to randomly drop points inside the box, then an estimate of $\\pi$ would be approximated by the total number of points inside the circle, divided by the total number of points in the box. To make it easier, we could create the 1x1 box in the upper right quadrant and inscribe a quarter circle inside the box. The ratio of inside/total would then be $pi/4$. This is the situation shown in the figure above.\n",
